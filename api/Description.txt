This Python script is designed to retrieve host, process, process group, and service data from Dynatrace APIs.
The script performs the following steps:

1. API calls: It sends HTTP GET requests to various Dynatrace API endpoints (hosts, processes, process groups, and services) 
to fetch data about the Dynatrace infrastructure.

2. Data transformation: It transforms the retrieved data into JSON format.

3. Data selection: It selects the desired columns from the JSON data and cleans up characters such as "[ ]" and "{ }" as needed.

4. Data appending: It appends the selected data to an empty list.

5. DataFrame creation: It converts the data from the list into DataFrame structures

6. DataFrame manipulation: It uses merge functions to add certain columns from other DataFrames to Process, process group, and service DataFrames. 
This enables the addition of desired data to the DataFrames.

7. Excel creation: The created DataFrames are converted to Excel files (.xlsx) and written to the specified file path in the operating system.
